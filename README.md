# Higgs-Boson-Signal-Processing

This project presents a detailed analysis of the Higgs boson through its diphoton decay channel, focusing on precise mass measurements and signal significance determination. The study employs advanced statistical methods including fourth-order polynomial background fitting and maximum likelihood estimation to analyze proton-proton collision data. The analysis achieves high-precision measurements of the Higgs boson mass and demonstrates strong statistical significance well beyond the conventional discovery threshold.
This work was conducted under the guidance of Professor Haichen Wang at UC Berkeley, contributing to the ongoing research in particle physics at the ATLAS Experiment.
